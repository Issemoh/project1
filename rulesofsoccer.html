                    <p>Basic Soccer Rules</p>

                    <p>No Hands, please</p>
                
                    <p>First, the rule for a hand ball includes using any part of the body from the tips of the fingers to the shoulder.
                    Second, the proper way to look at this soccer rule is that a player cannot “handle” the ball. 
                    A ball that is kicked and hits a player’s hand or arm is not a hand ball. 
                    This means that the referee must judge whether or not a hand ball is accidental contact or the player handled the ball on purpose to gain an advantage. 
                    There is also a situation in which the goalie cannot use his/her hands. This is sometimes called the back-pass rule.
                    Goalkeepers cannot pick up a pass that came directly from one of their teammates. In this case, the goalkeeper must use his feet. 
                    If the goalie does pick-up the ball it will result in an indirect kick from where he/she touched the ball.</p>

                <section class="boxmain">
                        <p>Throw-ins</p>

                        <p>A throw-in is taken when the ball crosses a sideline and leaves the field. 
                        The two basic soccer rules for a proper throw-in are to have both feet on the ground and to throw the ball with both hands over the head.</p>
    
                        <p>Corner kick: When the defending team last touches the ball and it crosses the goal line, 
                            the opposing team gets to kick the ball from the corner of the field.</p>

                        <p>Soccer Fouls: fouls can be any number of unfair advantages taken by a player that are called by the referee. 
                            These can include tripping, pushing, and touching the ball with the hands.
                             Free kicks or penalty kicks may be awarded to the opposing soccer team.</p>
                        
                   
                    <p>Penalty kick: When a foul occurs in the penalty area, the fouled team is awarded a penalty kick</p>
                    <p>Offside rules: You cannot be offside on a corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in. 
                            Also, it is not an offense for a player to be in an offside position.</p>
                    <p>Two-touch Rule: A player cannot touch the ball twice in a row when putting the ball in play.</p>
