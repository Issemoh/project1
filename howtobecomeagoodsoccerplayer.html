                    <p>Soccer is a great sport that anyone can get involved with and have fun playing. 
                        To become an advanced player, however, you need to start early and work hard. 
                        You'll need to work on your fitness, and learn to imitate the soccer greats,but make sure you're practicing the right things.</p>

                    <p>Improving Your General Play</p>
            
                    <p>Play as much as possible with friends or local club teams: 
                            Get your friends together for a pick-up game, or join your local club team to get touches each week. 
                            You will never get better if you aren't playing soccer as often as possible.</p>

                    <p>Pick up your pace of play: 
                            Advance players see someone, make a decision, and execute the pass, shot, or move in milliseconds.
                    </p>

                    <p>Use practice to improve your weak spots, not show off your talents:
                            Practice is where you get better, not where you keep repeating the skills you've already got down. 
                    </p>
                                    
                </section>
                <section class="boxmain">
                        <p>Watch the pros play:
                                A great way to learn is to watch someone who is more advanced than you, do it. 
                        </p>

                        <p>Take advice and guidance gracefully:
                            Your coach is there for a reason, and they can often see things that you cannot while you're playing. 
                        </p>
