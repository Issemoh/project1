                    <p>Soccer I think is the most energetic sport ever. Soccer is amazing to me.
                        People call us field fairies but it takes a lot more skill than you think.
                        I love running, it’s my obsession. I run outside of school almost every day.
                        About 6 miles a day. But enough about running. That’s what makes soccer the greatest sport ever to me.
                        The skill in soccer takes along time to master. I don’t even think you can master soccer. 
                        There are so many new things I learn at practice every day. The skill you need to play soccer it just over the top.
                        When you first play soccer, like first ever in your life your thinking wow, this is a lot more tricky than I thought it would be.
                        I know that’s what I was thinking when I first played.</p>
            
                    <p>Soccer is a very easy sport to learn and play.
                        Looking from the outside, it might seem really hard and confusing, but when you start learning, it is not that hard.
                        Soccer involves a ball and a human. There are other rules and complex technicalities involved, but, with time,
                        you would be able to understand them</p>
            
                    <p>I love soccer because it is fun, it’s a competitive sport, and also because it takes my mind off of things.
                        I hope this inspired you to play soccer or 
                        even just watch it on TV because it’s a great sport! But there are other sports that you may like even more.</p>
